# UFOs

### Overview

This was a pretty cool task, taking data and compiling it based on parameters set by the user.  The input allowed for filtering of the data relating to the ufo sightings for certain criteria.

### Results

The results are pretty straight forward: put stuff in, get stuff out.

### Summary

The webpage had limited data to pull from, but I guess thems the breaks.

I would recommend adding more data and having said data link to the submitters' facebook accounts so that they can be monitored by the public at large.
